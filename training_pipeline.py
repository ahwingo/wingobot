"""
Objective:
Train neural networks to play Go until they are really, really good.

Parts:
    -   Self Play: Have the current network play against itself to generate moves.
    -   Optimization: Randomly sample from the last 500,000 moves, training the network in mini batches of 8.
    -   Evaluation: Every X games, compare the current network to the previous best (to ensure the network is learning).
